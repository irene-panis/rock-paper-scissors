This is my first medium-scale project for The Odin Project. It is a simple website in which users play a game of Rock Paper Scissors against a computer. 
First to five points wins.<br/>

Thanks to this project, I was able to refresh my memory on HTML/CSS basics as well as practice my JavaScript skills.<br/>

I could have gotten away with a simple three-button design free of CSS styling, but I felt that it wouldn't be true to who I am. 
In my second year of college, I took my first programming course in which the final project was to create a simple website about myself. 
I spent hours animating the landing page just because I could despite it not being required. This project took me back to those days, 
and I knew it wouldn't feel right if I didn't try to push myself now like I did back then.<br/>

Thus, my website includes some attempts at animated elements, a "reset"/"try again" button to reset scores, timed disabling of buttons during animations to prevent
unwanted multiple inputs, and more.<br/>
